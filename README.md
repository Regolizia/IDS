# MATTY Smart Yoga Mat
## Website
For the course Interaction Design Studio 2019-2020 at Politecnico di Milano, our team had to develop an innovative idea.
We have designed and prototyped Matty, an interactive yoga mat that can reduce stress in ASD children.

To present our work we have created this website:
